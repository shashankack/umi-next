        question: "What is Matcha?",
        answer:
          "Matcha is a finely ground powder made from shade-grown tencha leaves, a specific type of green tea. Unlike regular green tea, where the leaves are steeped and removed, matcha is whisked into water or milk and consumed entirely, allowing you to ingest the whole leaf.",

              weeks before harvest, the tea plants are covered to block direct
              sunlight. This process boosts chlorophyll levels, giving the
              leaves a vibrant green colour and a naturally sweeter, umami-rich
              flavour.

              Only the youngest, most tender leaves from the top of the tea
              plant are carefully handpicked during the harvest season. Each
              seasonal harvest brings subtle differences in flavour, aroma and
              colour, contributing to the unique character of every batch of
              matcha.

              After steaming and drying the leaves (called tencha) are slowly

              silky, vibrant green powder which is matcha.

It can help boost metabolism, enhance focus and energy, and is packed with antioxidants – especially catechins like EGCG, which support overall wellbeing.

It is a key characteristic of matcha and can be a desirable flavour component. It adds complexity to the matcha flavour when well-balanced but excessive astringency can be unpleasant.",

        answer:
          " A chawan is a unique Japanese tea bowl that is used both for whisking and drinking matcha tea. A deep, wide chawan provides enough room for the chasen to move back and forth with ease, which is fundamental for producing froth and dissolving the matcha powder. The chawan&apos;s robust shape sits nicely in both hands.",

        question: "Chasen",
        answer:
          "A chasen is also known as the matcha whisk. It is a unique tool hand-crafted out of a single piece of bamboo, especially for whisking matcha powder into the perfect consistency. A standard chasen has anywhere from 80 to 120 prongs. While other matcha tools can potentially be substituted, we do not recommend replacing the chasen. It is an absolutely indispensable part of making matcha green tea.",

        answer:
          "A chashaku is a bamboo tea scoop used for measuring the proper amount of matcha powder. One full chashaku scoop of matcha is approximately1 gram. And one serving of matcha tea requires 2-3 grams of the green tea powder. The long elegant shape of the chashaku makes it easy to scoop the perfect amount of matcha each time. Always properly dry your chashaku after each use.",

          "A Kusenaoshi or whisk holder is a special tool for properly holding your chasen (tea whisk). You may have already noticed that this particular tool comes in an unusual shape. This shape is, in fact, the ideal for keeping your chasen as good as new and preventing it from shrinking. If properly cared for, your chasen can last you a long time, so we recommend investing in a chasen holder from the start. A shrunken chasen makes it all the harder to achieve that rich green foa.",

          "A furui or sieve is a tea strainer. Naturally, the matcha powder may have some small clumps, which are hard to break up even after whisking or shaking. Sifting the vibrant green matcha powder beforehand will ensure that the matcha is then effortlessly whisked, creating the smoothest matcha beverage imaginable. Since matcha is an extremely fine powder, we recommend getting a fine sifter to match.",

            All matcha is not organic. Organic matcha ensures no pesticides,

            constitutes a clean, pure final product free of contaminants and
            sustainable and environmentally friendly farming practices. To be

        question: "First Harvest",
        answer:
          "First harvest or first flush matcha refers to the tea leaves harvested in early spring, typically in late April to mid-May in Japan. These leaves are considered the highest quality and most tender due to their freshness and the time spent under shade, which enhances flavour and nutrients. This first harvest is often used to make high-grade ceremonial matcha. First harvest leaves are packed with nutrients and chlorophyll due to being shaded for a period before harvest. First harvest matcha contains more L-theanine, an amino acid responsible for the umami flavour.",

        question: "Single Origin",
        answer:
          "Single origin matcha means the matcha is produced from leaves grown in a single location, which could be a region, a prefecture, or even a single farm. This contrasts with blended matcha, which is a mixture of matcha from various origins. The single origin designation highlights the unique characteristics of that specific terroir, including soil, climate, and farming practices. Single-origin matcha offers a taste profile reflecting the specific terroir, unlike blended matcha, which often aims for a balanced and consistent flavour.",

        question: "Single Cultivar",
        answer:
          "Single cultivar matcha means the tea is made from the leaves of only one specific cultivar of the tea plant. Cultivars are bred or cultivated varieties, meaning they are selected and grown for specific flavours or characteristics, as opposed to wild or seed-grown plants. When matcha is labelled as &apos;single cultivar,&apos; it means that the matcha powder is made exclusively from the leaves of one specific tea plant cultivar. This allows the unique characteristics of that cultivar to shine through in the flavour profile.",

Coffee, on the other hand, provides a quicker, more intense energy boost but can also lead to jitters and a crash for some. Matcha offers a smoother, more sustained energy lift than coffee, thanks to its L-theanine content, which counteracts the jitters often associated with caffeine. A typical cup of matcha contains about 70 mg of caffeine. Coffee provides a quick and intense energy boost, but it can also cause jitters, anxiety, and a crash for some individuals but this isn’t the case in matcha as it offers a slow more sustained release in energy that keeps you active and balanced throughout the day.",
